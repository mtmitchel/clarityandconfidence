## Recent Enhancements (June 2025)

This project underwent a significant UX and functionality overhaul to improve clarity, empathy, and actionable guidance for users. Key improvements include:

### üîí Privacy-First Template Model

A major philosophical and functional update was implemented to put users in complete control of their sensitive data.

-   **Illustrative In-App Tools**: Record-keeping tools like the `CommunicationLog` and `ExpenseTracker` now serve as interactive examples rather than primary storage solutions.
-   **Downloadable CSV Templates**: For each record-keeping tool, users are now prompted to download a universal `.csv` template. This empowers them to maintain their official, private records on their own device using software they trust (like Google Sheets, Excel, or Numbers).
-   **Clear Guidance**: The UI has been updated with clear, non-patronizing language that explains *why* this approach is safer and puts the user's privacy first.
-   **Direct Google Sheets Integration**: Added a convenience button to open a new Google Sheet, making it easier for users to import the downloaded CSV template.
-   **Removed Obsolete Templates**: Deleted old, less-functional HTML templates in favor of the more universal and powerful CSV format.

This change moves the app from a simple data-entry tool to a more empowering "coach" that provides resources and guidance while respecting user autonomy and privacy.

### ‚ú® UX and Content Overhaul

- **Comprehensive Review**: Conducted a critical review of the entire user journey, focusing on making the content more empathetic, the tools more intuitive, and the guidance more actionable.
- **Welcome Page Redesign (`Welcome.tsx`)**: Restructured the welcome screen to establish a clearer visual hierarchy. The "Get a Personalized Roadmap" feature is now the primary call-to-action, guiding users to the most logical starting point.
- **Improved Initial Assessment (`InitialAssessment.tsx`)**: Refactored the assessment for a more supportive tone and clearer questions. The results are now displayed immediately upon completion, providing instant, tailored feedback.
- **Clarified Legal Paths (`LegalPaths.tsx`)**: Simplified the content to focus on the core differences between Divorce and Dissolution in Ohio, making the choice less overwhelming.

### üöÄ New Features

- **Communication Templates**: Added a brand-new section with pre-written, neutral templates to help users draft difficult messages to their spouse regarding key divorce-related topics.

### üõ†Ô∏è Technical Fixes & Stability Improvements

- **Asset Division Tool Fixed**: Resolved a critical bug where the "Add Item" button failed to work. The tool now functions correctly.
- **Enhanced User Feedback**: Added automatic scrolling and temporary highlighting to the Asset Division Tool, so users get clear visual confirmation when a new item is added.
- **Robust State Management**: Replaced the underlying `useLocalStorageState` hook with a more reliable implementation to prevent data loss and ensure UI consistency.
- **Smoother Navigation**: Implemented a "scroll-to-top" feature on section changes, preventing disorientation when navigating the app.
- **Code Health**: Fixed multiple bugs, including a React rendering error in the Initial Assessment and a JSX syntax error on the Welcome page. Removed unused components to streamline the codebase.
